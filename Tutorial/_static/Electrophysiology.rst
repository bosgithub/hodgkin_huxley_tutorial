Biological/Electronic Equivalence
=================================

This model relies on a basic equivalence between a biological membrane plus
embedded ion channels, and an electronic circuit.

The circuit can be described by this diagram:

The *membrane capacitance* (**C**) is taken to be a fixed property of the membrane.

Parallel to **C** are four "battery-capacitor" series; one for each of the ions
relevant to cellular dynamics.

Each of these four ion pathways are modeled as the product of the ion's
*conductance* (**g**) and its *reversal potential* (**V**), both of which vary
over time.
