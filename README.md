Hodgkin Huxley Tutorial
======================

This tutorial contains a side-by-side comparison of Python code that runs the [Hodgkin-Huxley equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin%E2%80%93Huxley_model) and generates plots with a [NeuroML2 implementation](http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fninf.2014.00079/abstract) of the same equations.  

This was originally created by [@joebowen](https://github.com/joebowen) on behalf of the [OpenWorm project](http://www.openworm.org).  

The latest version of the tutorial is visible [online at ReadTheDocs](http://hodgkin-huxley-tutorial.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
