Current-voltage characteristic
==================================

The current through an electronic component, with the corresponding 
potential difference (voltage) across it is called the 
`current-voltage characteristic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current%E2%80%93voltage_characteristic>`_.

This relationship is usually represented with an I/V curve, which is 
just that: a plot of current versus voltage.

This property is one characteristic used to when examining the 
behaviour of electonic circuits. Given the electronic-biological 
equivalence `discussed earlier <Electrophysiology.html>`_, it is 
easy to see how this property would also be useful in defining 
the behaviour of excitable membranes and their embedded ion channels.

The patch-clamp protocol
========================

In a patch-clamp experiment, a piece of membrane is sealed off from its
surrounding environment, such that there is almost no influence of external
electrochemical process on what is happening in this small "patch" of 
membrane.

By applying a voltage through this membrane patch, almost perfect
control of the membrane potential can be obtained. In this way, an
experimenter can hold the membrane at various voltages (fig. 1) and 
observe the current response that occurs (fig. 2).

    clamping.

Making I/V plots
================

With this data, we can now plot a current-voltage relationship, to help
us characterize and model the electrophysiological behaviour of the 
patch of membrane. 

We will consider two types of I/V curves here. The first is the so-called
"peak" I/V curve, where the largest current magnitude produced at each voltage
step is plotted against the voltage that produced it. We can see an 
example of this in figure 3.

The second type of I/V curve is called a "steady-state" I/V curve, and
is a representation of the somewhat leveled out current at the end of 
each voltage step, again plotted against the voltage step that produced
it. See figure 4 for an example of this type of I/V plot.

    Peak I/V Curve. Plotting the maximum current at each voltage step 
    produces a curve like this.

    Fig. 4

    Steady-state I/V curve. Plotting the current at the end of each 
    voltage step gives us a curve similar to this one.
